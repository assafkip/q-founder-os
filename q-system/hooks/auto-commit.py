# NO FALLBACK. An unclassified path is REPORTED, never committed (2026-08-07, ASK-498).
#
# This used to be `("chore", "update project files")`, so every path not named in
# AREA_MAP above -- an instance's own source tree, its tests, its config -- was swept
# into one unattended commit with a generic subject and no issue id.
#
# Measured cost in a single session on the consulting instance: three sweeps
# (d96e621, 7a252f4, f0a3183) carried real feature work onto `main` under
# "chore: update project files". Two of them also RACED the agent writing the files:
# a `git add` of new files reported success and staged nothing, because the hook had
# already committed them a moment earlier, and the agent's own commit then silently
# contained only half its change.
#
# The hook's purpose is a safety net for GENERATED STATE -- canonical files, session
# memory, marketing content -- that nobody would otherwise commit. Source code is the
# opposite case: it is exactly what an agent commits deliberately, with a real message
# and a Linear id. Sweeping it is not a safety net, it is a second writer to the same
# branch.
#
# Uncommitted is not lost: the files are on disk. What is removed here is an
# unattended commit nobody asked for. `report_skipped` makes the remainder loud
# rather than silent, so the safety net becomes a NOTICE for source code and stays a
# COMMIT for the generated state it was built for.

    # It was believed to be the line that swept another session's staged work into
    # this hook's commit (sp-78728ff1). It is not. `git diff --name-only HEAD` on the
    # line above ALREADY reports a staged-but-uncommitted new file: in a scratch repo,
    # `git add b` on a new file makes `git diff --name-only HEAD` print `b`. That is
    # sp-78728ff1's shape, so deleting this line fixes nothing.
    #
    # IT IS NOT UNIVERSALLY REDUNDANT, and the first draft of this comment claimed it
    # was ("added nothing any other probe missed"). Re-measured 2026-09-07 across six
    # staging shapes: `--cached` names two paths that `diff --name-only HEAD` and
    # `ls-files --others` both miss -- a file staged and then DELETED from the
    # worktree, and a file staged and then edited back to its HEAD content.
    #
    # Removing it is still right, and that reason is measured too, not reasoned:
    # commit_group runs a PATHSPEC commit, and `git commit -m x -- <path>` in BOTH of
    # those shapes exits 1 with "nothing to commit" and writes no commit. (The first
    # guess written here was that the delete shape would commit a DELETION of another
    # writer's staged file. It does not; the staged entry survives untouched.) So the
    # two extra paths only ever bought a spurious `skipped:` line. What this removal
    # gets is a narrower changed-file set, not a bug fix. Do not re-add it expecting
    # one, and do not cite it as coverage for sp-78728ff1.
    #
    # sp-78728ff1 IS THEREFORE STILL OPEN and needs a different fix than deleting a
    # line. Git cannot tell WHO staged a path, so the only honest lever is to treat
    # "staged" as "a writer has claimed this" and skip it, reporting it as skipped.
    # That trades away part of the safety net (work staged at session death would no

    THE THIRD WRITER (sp-4bff1b91, sp-d0ce1966, sp-e06433b8, measured 2026-09-06).
    `fleet_update_in_progress` above coordinates with the ONE writer that agreed to
    leave a marker. This hook is the writer nobody can negotiate with: it fires at
    every turn end in every session on the checkout, and it took no lock at all. Two
    sessions can hold a ref window perfectly and still lose a commit to it.

    Measured that night in one session: three of five git operations died on
    `Unable to create '.git/index.lock'`, and EVERY ONE EXITED 0. A commit that
    reports success while landing nothing is worse than one that refuses.

    WE READ THE LOCKS, WE DO NOT REMOVE THEM. Deleting a lock that a live 8-minute
    pre-commit still owns corrupts that commit's index. kipi-update.sh still sweeps
    HEAD.lock/index.lock/AUTO_MERGE.lock with an unconditional force-delete at the
    top of its instance loop, no pid, mtime or age test at all (~L1915, sp-50119dec;
    an earlier draft of this docstring cited L1714, which is unrelated env-var code).
    Read that citation narrowly: the SAME file is also the one that already solved
    this properly, at ~L1313-1400, where every index write it makes waits for the
    lock to clear, bounded at 600s, with bounded retry and a loud error
    (sp-523c1a25). A Stop hook cannot spend 600s at turn end, so it takes the other
    half of that answer: refuse now, and the next turn end picks the work up.

    NO AGE BOUND ON PURPOSE, unlike the run marker. A commit here holds index.lock
    for the length of its pre-commit, measured at 447-497 seconds here and
    independently at 445s in kipi-update.sh's own note from the same night. Review
    round 2 called that figure false, having measured ~12ms and no lock at all
    during a pre-commit. RE-MEASURED 2026-09-07 over three command shapes against
    a 5s pre-commit hook, and the figure stands: `git commit -m x -- <path>`,
    which is exactly what commit_group runs, holds index.lock (plus a next-index
    lock) for the WHOLE hook; `git commit -a` does too; only `git add` followed by
    a bare `git commit` holds nothing, and that is the one shape this hook never
    uses. Measure the pathspec form, or the number will look invented again. So a
    bound low enough to be useful against a crashed lock would fire constantly
    against healthy ones. A truly orphaned lock is rare, visible, and a human's
    call: "no process holds it AND every live hook's cwd is a worktree" is the test
    that settled it by hand, and it needs `lsof`, which a Stop hook must not spend.

    AND THAT BOUND COSTS LESS THAN THE FIRST DRAFT OF THIS DOCSTRING CHARGED IT.
    Measured 2026-09-07: git itself exits 128 on a held index.lock, and commit_group
    turns ANY non-zero into a `skipped:` line while this hook exits 0. So an orphaned
    lock ALREADY stopped this hook from committing, silently, before this guard
    existed. It replaces a failure found after a 450s pre-commit with a refusal
    that costs nothing. An earlier draft went further and said the guard adds NO
    new silent-outage mode; review round 2 proved that false, and it is true now
    only because of the fix it forced -- the refusal prints on stdout, because the
    fleet wiring discards stderr. See the comment in main(). The genuinely new
    behaviour is the opposite one, and it is frequent rather than rare: a peer
    session's `git status` holds index.lock for a fraction of a second, so some turn
    ends now skip a commit they would have won. Work stays on disk either way.

    --git-dir, NOT --git-common-dir, AND THE TWO GUARDS HERE DISAGREE ON PURPOSE.
    fleet_update_in_progress above reads the COMMON dir because a run marker is a
    claim on the whole checkout. A lock is not: index.lock and HEAD.lock are
    per-worktree. Measured 2026-09-07 -- holding <main>/.git/index.lock does not
    block a `git add` run from a linked worktree, and holding that worktree's own
    lock does (rc=128). So this spelling names exactly the lock that can stop THIS
    checkout. Harmonizing the two would silence the safety net in every linked
    worktree for the eight minutes the main checkout spends inside a pre-commit,
    over a lock none of them would ever contend. Pinned by
    test_a_worktree_does_not_refuse_on_the_main_checkouts_lock, the only test in the
    file that can tell the two spellings apart.
