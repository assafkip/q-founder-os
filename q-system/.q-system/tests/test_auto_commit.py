#
#     chore: update system infrastructure
#     - q-system/.q-system/capability-manifest.json
#
# and silently reverted five lines of a real capability-manifest entry. The
# path was ALREADY in the message; naming files was never the gap. Direction and
# magnitude were, so a deletion was indistinguishable from an update and a
# second session had to diff the commit by hand to find it. These cases pin the
# half that was missing, and `test_an_addition_is_not_labelled_a_deletion` is
# the discrimination control -- without it, a hook that stamped
# "DELETIONS ONLY" on every commit would pass the reproducer.

    indistinguishable on this checkout, which carries a dozen linked worktrees.

    MEASURED 2026-09-07, not reasoned: index.lock and HEAD.lock are PER-WORKTREE.

    checkout holds index.lock for its whole pre-commit (445-497s measured), so a
