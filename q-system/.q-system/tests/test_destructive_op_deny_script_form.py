"""sp-37c08fb1 + sp-dc76e644: a destructive op wearing a different filename.

TWO DEFECTS, ONE SHAPE. The deny hook matched the fleet updater's CLI phrase and
three of its script spellings, and it read only the COMMAND STRING. So:

  sp-37c08fb1  a path with no leading dot-slash, and the bare basename on PATH,
               were unmatched. Measured on origin/main 2026-09-07 by driving the
               hook: `projects/kipi-scheduled/kipi-update.sh --only X` ALLOWED.
  sp-dc76e644  a wrapper that assigns the founder bypass in its OWN text presents
               a command line carrying no destructive pattern at all. On
               2026-09-06 that ran a real fleet sync on the consulting instance
               and reverted a deliberate commit four minutes after it landed.

WHICH COPY THIS DRIVES, and why it is not the live hook. The anchor suite beside
this one prefers ~/.claude/hooks/destructive-op-deny.sh, because that is the copy
that really runs. This suite cannot: it asserts behaviour this change ADDS, and
the live copy only receives it when the founder runs apply-claude-changes on
q-system/output/claude-changes/sp-37c08fb1-fleet-updater-script-form.json. An
agent cannot write into ~/.claude (claude-path-write-guard blocks it, correctly:
an agent that can edit this hook can disable its own gates). Pointing this suite
at the live copy would therefore make it red on every machine until that apply,
which reads exactly like a broken change.

The install signal is kept, and kept in ONE place: the anchor suite's
test_the_vendored_copy_has_not_drifted compares the fixture to the live hook byte
for byte and goes red the moment they differ. That redness is the reminder.

KIPI_DESTRUCTIVE_HOOK overrides the target. That is the ref hatch this repo
already uses, and it is how every negative case below was watched to FAIL first:
pointing it at a pre-fix copy of the hook flips the four cases marked PRE_FIX.
A case that has never been observed failing is not a regression test.
