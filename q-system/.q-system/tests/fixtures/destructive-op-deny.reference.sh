# destructive-op-deny.sh - PreToolUse hook that denies destructive
# operations regardless of autonomy mode.
#
# This is the enforcement layer the PocketOS incident (2026-05-17)
# proved was missing in agent stacks: prompt-level rules are advisory,
# only hook-level rules are enforced.
#
# Bypass: set ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=1 in the founder's shell session.
# This requires explicit conscious action, which is the whole point.
#
# To revert: remove the PreToolUse entry pointing here from
# ~/.claude/settings.json, or `chmod -x` this file.
#
# THE EXECUTE BIT IS PART OF THE WIRING (ASK-1118, 2026-08-29). The revert line
# above is literally true, and that is the hazard: settings.json runs this as a
# BARE PATH, so `chmod -x` disarms the gate and NOTHING reports it -- no hook
# error, no audit line, no gate goes red. apply_claude_changes.py did exactly
# that by accident: its atomic temp-then-replace created the temp file at the
# default 0644, so landing a CORRECT content fix turned the guard off
# machine-wide, and it was found only because a canary file got deleted after
# the fix was already in this file. That tool now restores the bit on every
# write. If you ever see this file at 0644, the guard is OFF, not merely edited.

# DECIDED 2026-08-07: this hook does NOT try to tell prose from invocation.
#
# It fires on a heredoc that merely QUOTES a banned command -- writing a decision
# entry that cites a working-tree wipe as a comparison case gets blocked. That is a
# real false positive and it is the same shape rejected for the no-hourly lint: a
# denylist whose own documentation trips it is a gate someone switches off. It has
# now fired on documentation four times.
#
# It is still the right trade, because the obvious fix is a bypass. Stripping
# heredoc bodies before matching would open `bash <<'EOF' ... EOF`, which EXECUTES
# its body -- and `python3 - <<PY`, and `sh -s`, and every other interpreter that
# reads a script from stdin. Any parser that decides "this string is only prose" is
# a new bypass surface in the one hook standing between an agent and a production
# volume. The asymmetry is decisive: the miss costs a deleted volume, the false
# positive costs one tool call.
#
# The accepted workaround is the Write/Edit tool, which does not route through the
# Bash matcher and is the correct way to author a document anyway. The deny message
# now names it, so the block is signposted instead of merely confusing.
#
# What would change this: a payload field carrying the parsed command WORDS rather
# than the raw string. Matching argv is not guessing. Until then, prose pays a tool
# call and the gate keeps its teeth.

  #
  # Worse than the dry-run hole below, which needs a compound command. This is a

  # something people type deliberately. Same shape on `git push -q --force`,
  # `git branch -q -D`, `git clean -q -fd`, `git reset -q --hard`, and on
  # `git -C DIR reset --hard`, where a GLOBAL flag moves the subcommand along.
  #
  # HOW IT SURFACED, because the method matters more than the bug. Two agents
  # measured this guard and disagreed: one saw the removal form BLOCKED, the
  # other had run it twice with -q inserted. Neither was wrong, and it was nearly
  # filed as a long-flag-versus-short-flag runbook nit. Two contradictory
  # measurements of one guard meant the guard was broken. Chase a disagreement
  # like that; do not reconcile it.
  #
  # NOT A FOURTH PATTERN. Three patterns for three holes leaves the fourth. This
  # asks what the invocation actually IS: program, subcommand, and every flag

  # THE FLEET UPDATER AS A SCRIPT FILE, WITH ANY PATH PREFIX OR NONE.
  #
  # FLEET_DENY entry 3 is `[./~][^[:space:]]*kipi-update\.sh`: it requires the path
  # to START with a dot, a slash or a tilde. Measured 2026-09-07 by DRIVING this
  # hook, not by reading it -- the ledger item said the CLI phrase was the only
  # fleet pattern and that was already stale, PR #269 had closed two of the four
  # shapes. Re-measuring is what found the two that were left:
  #
  #   cd DIR && ./kipi-update.sh --only X       DENY   (entry 3)
  #   bash /abs/path/kipi-update.sh             DENY   (entry 2)
  #   /abs/path/kipi-update.sh                  DENY   (entry 3)
  #   projects/kipi-scheduled/kipi-update.sh    ALLOW  <- unmatched, real fleet sync
  #   kipi-update.sh --only X                   ALLOW  <- unmatched
  #   FOO=bar kipi-update.sh --only X           ALLOW  <- unmatched
  #
  # APPENDED RATHER THAN MERGED INTO ENTRY 3, for two independent reasons. The only
  # write path an agent has into ~/.claude is apply-claude-changes, whose `replace`
  # op is pinned to rule TEXT, so an in-place predicate edit cannot reach the live
  # hook at all -- it would land in the repo and never install. And
  # test_destructive_op_deny_anchor.py asserts FLEET_DENY holds exactly four
  # entries, three of them anchored; a fifth entry turns a passing guard test red
  # for a reason that has nothing to do with the guard.
  #
  # STILL ANCHORED AT COMMAND POSITION. The comment above FLEET_DENY records that an
  # unanchored first attempt blocked a `sed -n` read of this same filename, and
  # reading a file is not running it. `cat kipi-update.sh` stays allowed.
  #
  # kipi-update-instance-ahead.py is read-only and ends in .py, so a basename match
  # on kipi-update.sh cannot reach it in any of its three call shapes.
  #
  # Preview stages are skipped through the SAME predicate the block above uses, so
  # the dry-run flag alone in its own tool call still passes.
  # A SUBSHELL OR A GROUP OPENS A NEW COMMAND POSITION. The exact shape that ran
  # unchallenged on 2026-09-07 06:08Z was `cd DIR && ( ./kipi-update.sh --only X
  # > log 2>&1 & )`: after the `&&` split the stage begins with `(`, which is
  # neither the anchor nor a path, so every anchored layer above walked past it.
  # Measured 2026-09-07 by driving both the live hook and this fixture with that
  # command: ALLOW on both before this line. `([({][[:space:]]*)*` skips any run
  # of opening parens or braces; the path still has to be the command itself, so
  # `( cat kipi-update.sh )` stays a read.

  # A WRAPPER SCRIPT IS A DESTRUCTIVE OP WEARING A FILENAME.
  #
  # THE SCAR, measured 2026-09-06 14:55 PDT. ~/.config/kipi/consulting-sync-run.sh
  # set the founder bypass INSIDE ITS OWN TEXT. So the Bash command string this hook
  # sees was `bash ~/.config/kipi/consulting-sync-run.sh --verify-only`, which
  # carries no destructive pattern of any kind, every layer above it passed, and a
  # real fleet sync ran on consulting and reverted a deliberate instance commit four
  # minutes after it landed. The bypass is supposed to require conscious action in
  # the founder's own shell; a script that assigns it hands that action to whoever
  # types the script's name.
  #
  # So the target of a script invocation is READ, bounded, before it runs.
  #
  # TWO RULES, NOT ONE, and the split is the whole design:
  #
  #   a bypass ASSIGNMENT denies unconditionally. A --dry-run on the wrapper says
  #   nothing about whether the wrapper arms the bypass for what it calls.
  #
  #   a FLEET_DENY pattern in the body follows the same preview exemption as a
  #   direct match, so `bash kipi-update.sh --dry` keeps passing.
  #
  # COMMENT LINES ARE DROPPED FIRST, and that is not the prose-versus-invocation
  # distinction this file refused in 2026-08-07. That refusal was about the COMMAND
  # STRING, where `bash <<'EOF'` executes its own body and any parser deciding "this
  # is only prose" becomes a bypass surface. Here the subject is a FILE, `#` is the
  # shell's own comment marker, and a commented line cannot execute. Measured over
  # the 212 tracked .sh files in this repo: without the drop the fleet rule refuses
  # 16 ordinary scripts and the bypass rule refuses this hook's own deny message;
  # with it the fleet rule refuses 6, and all 6 genuinely invoke the fleet updater
  # (they are its own test suite). A gate red on 8% of its population gets switched
  # off, and a gate that is off protects nothing.
  #
  # ACCEPTED COST, stated rather than discovered later: those 6 updater tests now
  # need `kipi-approve` to be run through the Bash tool. That is the fail-closed
  # side, and the out-of-band approval already exists for exactly this.
  #
  # `bash -n FILE` is a SYNTAX CHECK, not a run, so it is skipped -- same reason the
  # patterns above are anchored at command position. Blocking a read gets the gate
  # switched off.
