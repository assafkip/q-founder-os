"""Engine test for the morning brief (ASK-1178).

RED FIRST. Every case here was written and seen to fail before
`morning-brief.py`, `morning-brief-deadman.py` or `slack_founder.py` existed.
The first run is a bare ImportError on all of them; that counts as red only
because the import assertions below name the missing module explicitly. A
collection error is NOT a red run (it means zero tests executed), so the module
loader returns a skip-free failure rather than blowing up at import time.

## What this suite may NOT do

No live data path. It never calls Slack, never calls `claude -p`, never reads
the founder's real Linear key, and never writes `~/.config/kipi/`. Every
outbound seam is either injected or refused by the chokepoint under
`PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`. Two cases assert those refusals directly, because a
chokepoint nobody tests is a chokepoint that gets removed in a refactor.

## The property the whole file exists for

A section that could not be read must never render like a section that was
empty. That is the defect that killed the 9-phase pipeline: it produced
nothing for 148 days and every consumer read the nothing as a quiet day.
So `test_every_section_can_say_failed_distinctly_from_zero` walks all four
sections and asserts the two renderings differ, section by section, rather
than spot-checking one of them.

#   1 has a due date at all (overdue since 2026-08-10)
