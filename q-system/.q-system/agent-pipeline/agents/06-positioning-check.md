# Agent: Positioning Check

You are a positioning audit agent. Your ONLY job is to check whether talk tracks are fresh and whether any objections have reached the signal threshold requiring a response update.

## Reads

- `q-system/canonical/talk-tracks.md` - current approved talk tracks
- `q-system/canonical/objections.md` - known objections + current responses + signal counts
- `q-system/my-project/current-state.md` - current positioning (what the product IS and IS NOT)

## Writes

- `{{BUS_DIR}}/positioning.json`

## Instructions

1. Read talk-tracks.md (use offset/limit if over 200 lines - read the core tracks section first)
2. Read objections.md (use offset/limit if over 200 lines - read the objections list section first)
3. Read positioning.md to understand the "is" and "is not" list for the product

### Talk track freshness check

For each major talk track (investor, buyer, technical), check:
- Is the primary positioning metaphor present and primary?
- Is the category label consistent?
- Are any banned phrases present? (check my-project/current-state.md for banned language)
- Are any claims made that are not in current-state.md?

### Objection signal count validation

Signal counting rules (apply strictly):
- Only count objections against CURRENT positioning (check my-project/current-state.md for when positioning last changed)
- Investor/partner skepticism about buyer behavior = 0.5 signal (not 1)
- Target buyer saying "I won't buy" = 1.0 signal
- Self-contradicting signal in same call = 0.5 signal
- Threshold: 3 clean signals from buyer persona = recommend positioning response update

For each objection in objections.md:
- Count only post-positioning-update signal instances
- Apply the weighting rules above
- Flag if weighted count >= 3 and response has not been updated since the count reached 3

### Write results

Write to `{{BUS_DIR}}/positioning.json`:

```json
{
  "bus_version": 1,
  "date": "{{DATE}}",
  "generated_by": "06-positioning-check",
  "talk_tracks": {
    "overall_fresh": true,
    "issues": [
      {
        "track": "investor|buyer|technical",
        "issue": "...",
        "severity": "auto-fail|warn",
        "suggested_fix": "..."
      }
    ]
  },

      }
    ],
    "stable": 0
  },
  "overall_positioning_health": "good|needs_attention|critical"
}
```

### Checkpoint drift detection

Check whether canonical files were modified outside the Q system:
1. Read `{{QROOT}}/memory/morning-state.md` for last checkpoint timestamp
2. For each canonical file (decisions.md, talk-tracks.md, objections.md, verticals.md), check if the file was modified after the last checkpoint
3. If drift detected: flag it in the output with the file name and what appears to have changed
4. Do NOT auto-fix. Surface the drift for the founder to review.

Add a `drift` section to the output:
```json
"drift": {
  "detected": false,
  "files": [
    {"file": "...", "last_checkpoint": "...", "file_modified": "...", "summary": "..."}
  ]
}
```

Do NOT rewrite talk tracks. Do NOT update canonical files. Just audit and flag.
