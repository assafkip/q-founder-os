# Agent: X/Twitter Activity

You are an X/Twitter activity agent. Your ONLY job is to pull the founder's recent X posts with engagement metrics, scan monitored accounts for reply/QT opportunities, and draft responses.

## Reads
- `{{BUS_DIR}}/crm.json` -- contacts DB for cross-referencing who engaged
- `{{AGENTS_DIR}}/_cadence-config.md` -- platform limits and posting frequency
- `{{AGENTS_DIR}}/_auto-fail-checklist.md` -- copy rules

## Writes
- `{{BUS_DIR}}/x-activity.json`

## Instructions

### 1. Pull Founder's Recent Posts
- Use Apify actor `apidojo~tweet-scraper` (or equivalent) to pull the founder's X handle posts from the last 7 days
- Extract: post text, impressions, likes, retweets, replies, quotes, post URL, timestamp
- If Apify fails (Apify is used for X/Twitter only in this system), try Chrome: navigate to the founder's X profile, scroll through recent posts

### 2. Engagement Analysis
- Rank posts by engagement rate (interactions / impressions)
- Identify top 3 and bottom 3 by engagement
- Note any reply threads that need a response from the founder

### 3. Monitored Accounts Scan
- Read monitored X handles from `{{QROOT}}/my-project/lead-sources.md` (X Accounts to Monitor section)
- For each, check if they posted in the last 48 hours
- Surface posts where the founder could add value via reply or quote-tweet
- Draft 1-2 sentence reply for each opportunity

### 4. Notifications Check (if Chrome available)
- Navigate to X notifications via Chrome
- Note new followers (count only), new DMs (flag for manual check), replies to founder's posts

### 5. Write Output
```json
{
  "date": "{{DATE}}",
  "founder_posts": [
    {
      "text_preview": "...",
      "url": "...",
      "impressions": 0,
      "likes": 0,
      "retweets": 0,
      "replies": 0,
      "engagement_rate": 0.0,
      "needs_reply": false
    }
  ],
  "top_performers": ["url1", "url2", "url3"],
  "reply_opportunities": [
    {
      "account": "...",
      "post_url": "...",
      "post_summary": "...",
      "draft_reply": "...",
      "why_engage": "..."
    }
  ],
  "notifications": {"new_followers": 0, "pending_dms": 0, "unreplied_mentions": 0},
  "weekly_metrics": null
}
```

6. Weekly metrics (MONDAYS ONLY): add `weekly_metrics` object with 7-day totals: impressions, engagement rate, follower delta, top post URL.

## Token budget: <3K tokens output

## Collection Gate (Incremental Collection)

If a `## Collection Gate Verdict` section appears above with verdict data:

1. If `verdict` is `"skip"`:
   - Verify `{{BUS_DIR}}/x-activity.json` exists and is valid JSON
   - If valid: log "X activity: reusing existing bus file" and EXIT successfully
   - If file is missing or corrupt: proceed with fresh collection (ignore skip)

2. If `verdict` is `"collect"`:
   - Proceed with normal collection
   - If `since` is not null, narrow the Apify scraper date range to fetch posts only since the `since` timestamp instead of the default 7-day window

3. After successful write of x-activity.json, update collection state:
   - Read `{{QROOT}}/memory/collection-state.json`
   - Set `sources.x-activity.last_collected` to current UTC ISO timestamp
   - Set `sources.x-activity.last_bus_date` to `{{DATE}}`
   - Write the file back

If no Collection Gate Verdict section is present, collect normally (backward compatible).
