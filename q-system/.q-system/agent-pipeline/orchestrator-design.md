# Morning Orchestrator - Agent Tool Design

> **Note:** This is the original design document. Some agents listed here were later replaced by deterministic Python scripts or consolidated into other agents. See `step-orchestrator.md` for the current execution plan.

## How it works

The orchestrator is a set of instructions that Claude Code follows using its native
Agent tool. Each "agent" is a markdown prompt file in `agents/`. Claude Code spawns
them as sub-agents (Sonnet for data pulls, Opus for synthesis).

## Phase execution

```
Phase 0: Preflight (sequential, must pass)
  -> Agent: 00-preflight.md (sonnet)
  -> Writes: bus/{date}/preflight.json
  -> If ready=false, HALT

Phase 1: Data Ingest (parallel - all independent pulls)
  -> Agent: 01-calendar-pull.md (sonnet)     -> bus/{date}/calendar.json
  -> Agent: 01-gmail-pull.md (sonnet)        -> bus/{date}/gmail.json
  -> Agent: 01-crm-pull.md (sonnet)       -> bus/{date}/crm.json
  -> Agent: 01-vc-pipeline-pull.md (sonnet)  -> bus/{date}/pipeline.json
  -> All launched in a single message with multiple Agent tool calls

Phase 2: Analysis (parallel where possible)
  -> Agent: 02-meeting-prep.md (sonnet)      -> bus/{date}/meeting-prep.json
  -> Agent: 02-warm-intro-match.md (sonnet)  -> bus/{date}/warm-intros.json

Phase 3: Social Activity (sequential - browser access needed)
  -> Agent: 03-social-posts.md (sonnet)      -> bus/{date}/social-posts.json
  -> Agent: 03-social-dms.md (sonnet)        -> bus/{date}/social-dms.json
  -> Agent: 03-pipeline-health.md (sonnet)   -> bus/{date}/pipeline-health.json

Phase 4: Content (sequential - routing depends on signals)
  -> Agent: 04-signals-content.md (sonnet)   -> bus/{date}/signals.json
  -> THEN: 04-value-routing.md (sonnet)      -> bus/{date}/value-routing.json

Phase 5: Pipeline & Sourcing (parallel scoring, then sequential)
  -> Agent: 05-temperature-scoring.md (sonnet) -> bus/{date}/temperature.json
  -> Agent: 05-lead-sourcing.md (sonnet)       -> bus/{date}/leads.json
  -> THEN: 05-engagement-hitlist.md (opus)     -> bus/{date}/hitlist.json

Phase 6: Compliance (parallel)
  -> Agent: 06-compliance-check.md (sonnet)    -> bus/{date}/compliance.json
  -> Agent: 06-positioning-check.md (sonnet)   -> bus/{date}/positioning.json

Phase 7: Synthesis (sequential, opus)
  -> Agent: 07-synthesize.md (opus)
  -> Reads ALL bus/{date}/*.json
  -> Writes: output/schedule-data-{date}.json

Phase 8: Build + Verify (sequential)
  -> Bash: build-schedule.py (builds HTML from JSON)
  -> Agent: 08-visual-verify.md (haiku)      -> bus/{date}/visual-verify.json
  -> Bash: audit-morning.py (validates log)
```

## Key rules

1. Each agent prompt includes: what bus/ files to READ, what bus/ file to WRITE
2. Agents that read social posts must save FULL TEXT, never summaries
3. Haiku for data pulls, scrapes, and simple writes. Sonnet for analysis/content. Opus only for synthesis and engagement hitlist.
4. If any Phase 0-1 agent fails, HALT everything
5. Phases 2+ can degrade gracefully (log failure, continue)
6. Bus files are JSON. Agents parse JSON in, write JSON out.
7. Bus directories older than 3 days are cleaned in Phase 0

## Token budget estimate

- Each Sonnet agent: ~2-5K tokens
- Opus synthesis: ~10-15K tokens
- Opus hitlist: ~8-12K tokens
- Total: ~60-80K tokens across all agents
- vs monolithic: ~100-150K tokens in one context
- Savings: ~30-50% + better quality per step
