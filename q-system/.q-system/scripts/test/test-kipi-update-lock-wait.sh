# says which step is waiting, retries a commit that died on it, and refuses
# the instance only when the lock outlives the bound.
#
# 2026-09-06 14:30, consulting: the q-system commit landed, the config commit
# died seconds later on "Unable to create '.git/index.lock': File exists",
# and the instance was abandoned half-delivered. The holder was a peer
# session's `git status`, which takes that lock for a fraction of a second to
# refresh the index. The stale-lock deletion at the top of the instance loop
# only covers a crashed writer's leftover (sp-2c1bcc3f); a live writer needs a
# wait, not a delete (sp-523c1a25). The run marker written for the hook's
# half (sp-9306036e) is what lets this test hold the lock at exactly the
# right moment: the holder waits for the marker, then takes the lock, so the
# first index write of the run meets a live lock every time.
