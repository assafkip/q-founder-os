# Reviewer run safety: the verdict survives a kill, a judged head is not

# THE THREE SCARS, all measured on 2026-09-05 to 2026-09-07:
#
#   sp-fa810306  PR #314 round 3 posted APPROVE WITH NITS as a comment at
#                00:29:47Z on head adc29516, the process died before the commit
#                status call, `gh api statuses adc29516` came back empty, and the
#                next session re-ran the same head at 00:36:54Z. The re-run
#                returned REQUEST CHANGES and overturned the approval.
#   sp-0a09e013  five reviewers and watchers killed under memory pressure in one
#                evening, then a 00:35Z process exit orphaned two more. Nothing on
#                the box could answer how many reviews were live.
#   sp-46726f79  rounds 1 to 3 of PR #314 each named another unwaited index write.
#                Three patches, one class. The round cap came from the founder.
#
# HOW THIS DRIVES THE REAL SCRIPT. Same harness as
# test-review-dry-run-labelled.sh: the SHIPPING pr-review-agent.sh is copied into
# a fixture repo three levels down so its own root guard passes, and it runs
# against a `gh` stub, a fake engine, and a HOME under mktemp. No live PR is read,
# no model is spent, no commit status is posted anywhere real.
#
# EVERY REFUSAL CASE NAMES ITS RED-MAKING INPUT, because a check that cannot fail
# for the reason you care about is decoration (lessons:
# a-check-must-be-able-to-fail-for-the-reason-you-care-abou). Each one was run
# against the pre-fix script first and recorded RED; the comments say so per case.
