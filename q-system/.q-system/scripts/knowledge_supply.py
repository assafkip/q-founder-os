"""knowledge_supply: the read side of the instance knowledge base.

Given a prompt, resolve the entities it names and the class of task it is, read
the instance's own stores through the source classes the manifest declares for
that class, and hand back a bundle of VERBATIM excerpts (each with path and line,
a date and a status label) plus a receipt that names every declared source as
searched, empty, or absent. The hook `knowledge-inject.py` renders the bundle
into UserPromptSubmit context. Tests: test_knowledge_supply.py.

WHY (knowledge-supply plan, 2026-09-04): every store here already had a writer
and a guard. kb-graph-guard.py blocks a session close when entity files outgrow
graph.jsonl, commitments.py drops any promise it cannot quote verbatim, and the
decision log refuses an entry without an origin tag. NOTHING READ ANY OF IT on
the prompt path. Measured: 0 bytes injected for "who at 14 Peaks did we talk to
and what did they push back on". A store with no retrieval trigger is folklore
with a timestamp (lesson: a-knowledge-store-with-no-retrieval-trigger).

WHY A MANIFEST AND A RECEIPT, not just a grep: "I did not find it" and "I never
searched the source it lived in" are different sentences. The manifest declares
the source classes a task class needs; the receipt records each one as present,
empty, or absent; the first line of the payload says FULL or PARTIAL and names
what was missing. That is the check from the lesson "assert what went into a
composed artifact, not just that it came out valid": every declared input gets
a status, and a missing one is a recorded fact, never a silent omission.

WHY VERBATIM AND NEVER A SUMMARY: a summary is a copy that goes stale while the
source moves. This module has no summarize path; test_every_excerpt_is_verbatim
asserts each excerpt is a substring of its source. The model opens the src when
it matters; read-first-gate.py already teaches that shape.

WHY SINGLE-TOKEN GRAPH ENTITIES NEVER FIRE ALONE: the largest instance's graph subjects
include "Mark", "Lisa", "David". A hook that fires on "mark the file as done"
is noise, and every previous guard that produced noise got switched off
(kb-graph-guard.py docstring). Identifier kinds the manifest lists (client
slugs, meeting keys) fire on a whole-word match; multi-token names fire on a
phrase match; a bare first name fires only mid-sentence and only when it is the
first token of exactly one multi-token entity (measured from the replay, commit
184fcfbc), never at the start of a sentence, a line or a bullet. The misses
ledger records what the prompt named that the index could not resolve, which is
the data the Phase 2 decisions run on.

WHY STATUS LABELS COME FROM provenance-vocabulary.json: that file is the ONE
vocabulary, loaded at runtime by two lints already. A second table here would
drift the way the first two did on 2026-07-28 (the scar recorded in that file).

WHY STORES, DOCS AND PROMPT-DRIVEN CANDIDATES (founder-directed 2026-09-05, plan
knowledge-supply-project-folders-2026-09-05): "every project reads its own folder,
and each 4_points investigation is its own knowledge base." Measured before this:
4_points had 45 investigation folders and 1,475 markdown files that no source
class covered (index: 40 graph entities); a consulting instance had 83 files and an index of 0, so the reader never woke up there. Three additions, all declared as data in
the manifest: `stores` (a glob of sub-directories, each a knowledge base with the
qroot layout; naming one in the prompt scopes the search to it), a `docs` class
(the project's own markdown folders, one grep pass per prompt, Python fallback),
and prompt-driven candidates (a capitalized word the index cannot resolve is
searched case-sensitively in the docs; a hit makes it an entity, a miss stays a
miss). Headings never index: the heading census across every case file was
section labels (Notes, Summary, Integrity), not names.

Contract: pure functions over paths. supply() writes only the receipt and misses
ledgers under <qroot>/memory/, both untracked jsonl like graph.jsonl, through
one append function. record=False writes nothing (replay and tests). Any store
that fails to parse is reported in the receipt, never raised past supply().
stdlib only.
