"""The consulting half of the morning brief: clients, the GTM move, the inbox.

Founder, 2026-09-03, on finding the board full of builds and Sana's Linear queue:
*"This isn't -- I'm not looking for this to be a build dashboard, but a consulting
dashboard."* Then, on how to get there: *"copy it but everyting needs to be actually
connected fully and is automated so its not done by hand"*.

## MIRROR, never a second derivation. This is the whole design.

`consulting/q-consult/pipeline/state_card.py` already computes what he asked for, every
morning at 07:30 PT: which clients are red, what he promised each of them in his own
words, who to reach out to. `gtm-queue.json` already carries the one GTM move. This
module READS those OUTPUTS. It does not open `clients.json`, it does not import
`pipeline`, and it never recomputes a verdict.

The rejected alternative was a `collect_clients` that read the registry itself. Two
reasons it is struck, and the second is the expensive one:

  1. `clients.json` is 162 rows, of which ~150 are cold hunt-list prospects with no rate
     and no next_touch. A flat read puts 150 dead rows on his morning board.
  2. Two things deriving one truth is how the v1 Notion CRM died. His own verdict on it:
     "died because it was hand-fed". The fleet rule that came out of that (DEC-8/DEC-13,
     `gtm_board.py`, `board_sync.py`) is that the board is a MIRROR and one writer owns
     the computed state. A second derivation is a second writer wearing a reader's coat.

## STALENESS IS AN ERROR, never a quiet mirror

The card is written at 07:30 and this repo COMMITS the brief at 07:40, after it. The
old text here said "runs after it" and was right about the intent; what it could not say
is that the LOADED job on the founder's machine had drifted to 07:00 and ran forty
minutes early for four days. See CARD_WRITTEN_AT.

So a card stamped yesterday is two different facts depending on the hour. Before 07:30
it is simply the newest card that exists, and it is used and LABELLED as yesterday's, on
the brief and on the board. After 07:30 the 07:30 job has run or failed, so the same
card is a real failure and returns an ERROR naming the age. What never happens either
way is yesterday's clients rendered as though they were this morning's: a mirror whose
source is stale and which still looks fresh is worse than a blank section, because he
would act on it.

That is the same law the rest of this brief already lives under -- an empty section and a
broken section are different facts -- applied to a third case the fixed four never had,
which is a section whose source is READABLE and WRONG.

## The cross-repo boundary

kipi-system reads the consulting instance's output FILES. It never imports `pipeline`,
which is the same boundary `consulting/q-consult/pipeline/tests/test_boundary.py` holds
in the other direction. `CONSULTING_ROOT` is resolved from `$KIPI_CONSULTING_ROOT` or
from `Path.home()`, never a literal home path (the content tripwire refuses one).

OFF switch: a missing consulting instance. `collect` returns None when the q-consult
directory is absent, so this renders no section at all rather than four COULD NOT READ
lines. The skeleton ships to instances that have no consulting book, and a fleet-wide
script must be silent on a machine the feature does not apply to.

#: How many client lines reach the brief. The card itself carries every red row; the
#: Slack section is a summary and the Notion board is the full surface. 6 is the count
#: that fits the founder's screen without scrolling, measured against the 2026-09-03 card
#: (7 red). A withheld count is always printed rather than the rest being dropped silently.
MAX_CLIENT_ROWS = 6
#: WHEN THE STATE CARD IS WRITTEN, from `io.askconsulting.ask-crm-state-card.plist`
#: (StartCalendarInterval 07:30 PT). This repo's `com.kipi.morning-brief.plist` commits
#: 07:40, DELIBERATELY after it: f9f74ac1 set that minute on 2026-09-04 in the change
#: that made this board mirror the card. So on the shipped schedule a card stamped
#: yesterday never happens, and this window never opens.
#:
#: IT OPENED FOR FOUR DAYS BECAUSE THE LOADED JOB HAD DRIFTED. The copy in
#: ~/Library/LaunchAgents said 07:00, forty minutes early, and never picked up the
#: committed 07:40. Measured in ~/.config/kipi/logs/morning-brief.out.log: the refusal
#: fired on the 09-05 and 09-07 runs, and today-card.md was last written 09-07 07:30.
#: The cost was a P0 "Your book: COULD NOT READ" row painted on his board every morning.
#:
#: I SAID IT WAS "CLEARED BY NOTHING" AND THAT WAS WRONG (PR #335 reviewer round 3,
#: minor). `com.kipi.morning-inbox` commits twelve repaints a day, 08:05 to 19:05, and
#: the 08:05 one archives that row. What was true is narrower and worse: that job was
#: not installed on his machine AT ALL, no plist in ~/Library/LaunchAgents and no
#: launchctl entry, so on his machine nothing repainted and the row stood all day. I
#: read the machine, the reviewer read the repo, and the gap between them is the
#: defect twice over. Both are installed now.
#:
#: TWO JOBS, ONE FAILURE MODE: the brief drifted to a stale schedule and the repaint was
#: missing outright. Nothing detects either, which is sp-de7afcff.
#:
#: THIS WINDOW IS NOT THAT FIX and does not pretend to be. It is what an early run
#: should DO: use the newest card there is and label it, rather than paint a P0 he
#: cannot act on about a job that has not run yet. A hand-run before 07:30 takes the
#: same path, which is how the drift was found.

    Founder, 2026-09-03: *"This week should be this week's GTM moves and deliverables

    description copied off a reference board describing a Sunday planning ritual he
    does not have, so it would have stayed empty forever while claiming to be "the
    plan".

    Two sources, both already on disk:

    - The GTM queue's founder-performer steps that are ready. `read_gtm` takes the

    - Open commitments whose due date lands inside the next `WEEK_DAYS`. An OVERDUE
      one is deliberately excluded: it is already red in Top of Mind, and showing it
      in both places teaches him the two sections mean the same thing.

    Which of the two sources answered THIS RUN, as the scopes they emit. Codex round 6

    could not archive inside them and a delivered commitment sat on the board forever.
    Reported per SOURCE rather than per section, because the section has two of them and
    one being down says nothing about the other.

    A scope is healthy only when its source was READ. An absent commitment book is OFF
    rather than broken (no error row), and it is still not healthy: a file that is not
    there has said nothing about the rows written when it was, and nothing is not "they

# They scrubbed volatile tokens out of a rendered line so the line could be hashed
# into a board-row identity. Four Codex rounds each added one more pattern -- the
# health dot, "2h ago", a bare digit run that collapsed "invoice 4021" and
# "invoice 4022" into one row, and finally the `[2h]` the real mail producer emits,
# which the round-2 fix had never seen because the test drove a fixture instead.
#
# Every one of those is the same defect: an identity derived from PRESENTATION.
# Rendering changes, so the regex could only ever chase it, and each fix bought one
# round. Producers now emit `morning-brief.Row(line, key)` carrying the id they
# already had -- a Gmail thread id, a GroupMe conversation id -- and `buckets` refuses
# a row without one. `test_no_identity_is_derived_from_rendered_text` fails if this
# file ever grows a text-scrubbing identity again.

#: Priority from the STATE CARD'S OWN VERDICT, never a second judgement. The card
#: already decides severity per client every morning (state_card.py: red = an open
#: promise past due, yellow = due inside 48h, and so on) and `board_sync.HEALTH` turns

#: P0-P3 vocabulary.

        # flip back creates a fresh page: it loses the Status he set AND anything he
        # typed into Link or Next, which this same change went to trouble never to
        # blank on a live row (round 10, minor: the comment named only Status and that
        # undersold it). Kept anyway: he asked for these rows gone in as many words,
        # Status
        # was measured unused on 2026-09-07 (12 of 12 rows read "Not started", the
        # painter writes it create-only and nothing else moves it), and the only fix
        # that preserves it is restoring the archived page instead of creating a new
        # one, which needs the archived id kept somewhere because Notion's query
        # returns no archived rows. That is real and is captured, not forgotten.
