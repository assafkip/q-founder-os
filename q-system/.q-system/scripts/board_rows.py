"""Paint the Kipi backlog ROWS from the consulting state. The board's row writer.

Founder, 2026-09-03: *"copy it but everyting needs to be actually connected fully and is
automated so its not done by hand"*.

## Rows, not bullets, and that is measured rather than preferred

The Morning board page holds four `child_database` blocks, read live 2026-09-03:
heading_2, paragraph, child_database, four times. Its three founder sections are FILTERED
VIEWS of one database, "Kipi backlog", split by the `Bucket` select. So a writer that
appends bullets under the "Top of mind" heading puts loose text between that heading and
its database, and the board's own views never see it.

The ids cost an hour and are recorded so nobody re-derives them:

  page               ~/.config/kipi/notion-board-page
  Kipi backlog DB    0a09bd16-b12e-49bf-a792-fad15e008ed0   <- writes go here
  data source        3017ad50-...   404s on /v1/databases; it is not an API database id
  the page's blocks  3cfbf98c-...   LINKED VIEWS, queryable, not the source of truth

## HIS DRAG ALWAYS WINS. This module never moves a row HE moved.

`Item id` carries "stable id the brief uses so a hand-moved item is never re-added". So:
create a row that does not exist, refresh the Notes and Source of one that does, and
never move a row a human put somewhere. That is `gtm_board.record_paint`'s posture
(painting is not deciding) and DEC-8/DEC-13's one-writer rule. The computed state is
authoritative about WHAT is owed; he is authoritative about where it sits on his board.

The first cut of that read "NEVER write `Bucket` on an existing row", which is a wider
rule than the promise and Codex round 6 (major) is what it cost: a client going red ->
green kept its old bucket forever and a human had to reconcile the board by hand. A
stale value the MACHINE painted is not his drag.

The two are told apart the way `gtm_board.apply_board_moves` does it: every write
records `bucket=` in the row's own Notes, which is what this module last painted there.
Nothing else writes that column, so a live value differing from the record is a human.

One deliberate divergence from gtm_board, and it is the whole design: there a drag is
applied back through `set_state`, so the computed state BECOMES his choice and adopting
the live value as the next baseline is right. Here health is computed from the state
card and no drag can change it, so adopting would make the record agree next morning and
move his row back one run later. A row he has moved is therefore PINNED (`pinned=1` in
the same note) and this module never sets its bucket again.

## Rows leave when the work does

An owned row whose id is no longer in the computed set is ARCHIVED, not deleted, and only
if we own its id prefix. Without this the board only ever grows, which is how the last
board became 4 stale rows nobody trusted. A row he created by hand carries no owned
prefix and is never touched.

## A stale source writes NOTHING

OFF switch: a missing `~/.config/kipi/notion-token`. `collect` returns None and no board
section renders. `~/.config/kipi/notion-backlog-db` overrides the database id without a
code change; its absence falls back to DEFAULT_DB rather than switching the module off,
because a token with no db file is a configured board, not an unconfigured one.

## A stale source writes NOTHING

If `consulting_board.buckets` reports an error (the state card is yesterday's, or the
07:30 job crashed), this writes no rows at all and returns that error. Mirroring a stale
source onto a board that looks fresh is the one failure that would make him act on a
wrong number.

    A producer-side cap on mail was removed because trimming DATA meant a still
    unanswered thread never entered `wanted`, and the archive loop then deleted its
    live page inside a healthy scope -- a dragged, pinned row gone because a
    sixteenth thread arrived.

    Uncapped mail then took the whole 40-row budget in source order, so every
    GroupMe row fell past it. Those rows are protected from archiving by `capped`,
    which is round 11's rule working, but protected is not updated: they sit on his
    board unchanged forever while the source that starved them refreshes daily. A
    channel he asked for, permanently frozen, with nothing saying so.

    Capping the producer brings back defect one. Not capping it is defect two. So
    neither is the answer: what was wrong is that a single source could spend the
    whole budget. Each scope now takes one row in turn, so a busy inbox delays the
    tail of its OWN source rather than deleting another source's channel.

    Order within a scope is preserved (the mail prompt sorts oldest first, and that
    ordering is a judgement this function must not re-make). Rows past the budget
    still land in `capped` at the call site and are kept, never archived.
