# User Archetypes

When a new user starts setup, determine their archetype FIRST. This controls which integrations to offer and which parts of the system to emphasize.

## How to Detect

**The archetype question text lives in `setup-flow.md` Step 0.** Use that version (it has full explanations for each option). Do NOT use the short descriptions below - they're just for quick reference.

Map the answer:

| Answer | Archetype ID | Label |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| A | `gtm-founder` | GTM Founder |
| B | `product-founder` | Product Founder |
| C | `content-creator` | Content Creator |
| D | `operator` | Operator / Chief of Staff |
| E | `minimal` | Explorer |

Save the archetype ID to `my-project/founder-profile.md` under `## Archetype`.

## Integration Maps

Each archetype has a required, recommended, and optional tier. Only walk the user through required + recommended. Mention optional once at the end.

### gtm-founder
**Focus:** Pipeline management, outreach, meeting prep, relationship tracking

| Tier | Integration | Why |
|------|------------|-----|
| Required | Notion OR Obsidian | CRM: contacts, pipeline, actions (Notion = cloud DB views, Obsidian = local markdown) |
| Required | Google Calendar | Meeting prep in morning routine |
| Required | Gmail | Draft follow-ups, track threads |
| Recommended | Chrome automation | LinkedIn profiles, posts, DMs, engagement |
| Optional | Apify | X/Twitter scraping for lead sourcing |
| Optional | Telegram | Message contacts directly |
| Optional | Gamma | Generate pitch decks and one-pagers |

### product-founder
**Focus:** Stay organized, occasional outreach, don't lose track of conversations

| Tier | Integration | Why |
|------|------------|-----|
| Required | Notion OR Obsidian | Task tracking, light CRM |
| Recommended | Google Calendar | Know what's coming today |
| Optional | Gmail | Draft emails when needed |
| Optional | Apify | X/Twitter scraping for research |

### content-creator
**Focus:** Content pipeline, audience engagement, social presence

| Tier | Integration | Why |
|------|------------|-----|
| Required (CLI/Desktop) | Chrome automation | LinkedIn engagement, post scraping, DMs |
| Recommended | Notion OR Obsidian | Content calendar, asset library |
| Optional | Apify | X/Twitter scraping for engagement |
| Optional | Gamma | Create visual content, slide decks |
| Optional | Google Calendar | Schedule content drops |

**Web users (claude.ai/code):** Chrome automation is not available. Recommend Notion or Obsidian as the primary integration instead. Say: "On the web version, I can't automate LinkedIn directly. I'd recommend connecting Notion or Obsidian to track your content pipeline. You can still use `/q-engage` to generate comments - you'll just paste them manually."

### operator
**Focus:** Keep the founder on track, manage calendar, follow up on actions

| Tier | Integration | Why |
|------|------------|-----|
| Required | Notion OR Obsidian | CRM, action tracking, pipeline |
| Required | Google Calendar | Calendar management |
| Required | Gmail | Email drafts, follow-ups |
| Optional | Apify | X/Twitter research for the founder |

### minimal
**Focus:** Try the system with zero friction

| Tier | Integration | Why |
|------|------------|-----|
| None required | -- | Everything runs on local files |

Tell the user: "You're all set. The system works with just local files. Your files are already an Obsidian vault if you want to browse them visually. Just say 'connect my obsidian' or 'connect my calendar' anytime."

## Progressive Enhancement

After setup, the system should detect when an unconnected integration would help and gently suggest it. Examples:

- Morning routine without Calendar: "I can't see your meetings today. Want to connect Google Calendar? Just say 'connect my calendar'."
- Debrief without CRM: "I saved this debrief to local files. If you connect Notion or Obsidian, you get visual CRM views of all your relationships."
- Engagement hitlist without Chrome: "I can write better comments if I can see actual LinkedIn posts. Want to connect Chrome? Just say 'connect my chrome'."
- Research or competitive analysis without research mode: "I'm making claims here that I haven't verified. Want me to switch to research mode? I'll cite everything. Just say '/q-research'."

**Rules for suggestions:**
- Maximum once per session per integration
- Never pressure. Always frame as "whenever you're ready"
- If they say no or ignore it, don't ask again for 7 days
