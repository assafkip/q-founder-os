# Morning Routine Preflight & Execution Harness

> This file is the single source of truth for what tools are available, what's broken, how to recover, and whether the routine actually completed. Read this BEFORE commands.md on every `/q-morning` run.

---

## 1. Tool Manifest

Every tool the morning routine depends on, its exact test, known limitations, and what to do when it fails.

### Critical (halt if unavailable)

| Tool | Test Command | Pass Criteria | Known Limitations | Fallback |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Google Calendar** | `mcp__claude_ai_Google_Calendar__gcal_list_events` with `timeMin=today 00:00`, `timeMax=today+7 23:59` | Returns `events` array (even if empty) | None known | None. Halt. |
| **Gmail** | `mcp__claude_ai_Gmail__gmail_search_messages` with `q: "after:YYYY/M/D"` (yesterday) | Returns `messages` array | None known | None. Halt. |
| **Notion API** | `mcp__claude_ai_Notion__notion-search` with query "Contacts" | Returns matching databases/pages | Cloud Notion integration -- full read/write support via `notion-fetch`, `notion-create-pages`, `notion-update-page` | None. Halt. |
| **Chrome** | `mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_context_mcp` | Returns tab list | Alerts/dialogs block all further commands. Avoid triggering them. | None. Halt. |
| **Apify (X/Twitter ONLY)** | Check if any `mcp__apify__*` tool is available via ToolSearch. If not, test REST: `curl -s "https://api.apify.com/v2/acts?token=$APIFY_TOKEN&limit=1"` | MCP: tool schema returned. REST: JSON with `data` array. | MCP tools sometimes don't load in a session. Apify is used ONLY for X/Twitter scraping. | **REST API fallback** (X/Twitter only). If Apify is down, fall back to Chrome for X. |
| **Reddit MCP** | `ToolSearch("+reddit")` then call `mcp__reddit__search` with query "test" | Returns structured post data | No auth needed. Zero-config. Runs via `uvx reddit-no-auth-mcp-server`. | Skip Reddit scraping. Do NOT use Chrome for Reddit. |
| **RSS Feeds (Medium/Substack)** | `WebFetch(url="https://medium.com/feed/tag/cybersecurity", prompt="How many articles?")` | Returns a count or description | WebFetch processes via model, not raw XML. Medium/Substack only (Reddit uses its own MCP). | Chrome browser navigation. |

### Non-Critical (ask founder before proceeding without)

| Tool | Test Command | Pass Criteria | Known Limitations | Fallback |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| **VC Pipeline API** | `curl -s http://localhost:5050/api/pipeline` via Bash | Returns JSON with pipeline data | Must be running locally. Founder needs to start the local pipeline server. | Skip Steps 1.5 (warm intro matching). Note in briefing. |

### Confirmed Working Apify Actors (X/Twitter only)

| Actor | Input Format | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `apidojo~tweet-scraper` | Profile mode: pull recent tweets from handles. Search mode: works but limited. | Monitored handles: @BushidoToken, @clintgibler, @RyanGCox_, @obadiahbridges |

### Reddit MCP Tools (validated Apr 2026)

Reddit uses its own MCP server (`reddit-no-auth-mcp-server`). No API key needed. Returns structured data with full post text.

| Tool | Arguments | Returns |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `mcp__reddit__search` | query, limit, sort (relevance/hot/top/new/comments) | Posts with title, URL, author, content, score |
| `mcp__reddit__search_subreddit` | subreddit, query, limit, sort | Posts scoped to one subreddit |
| `mcp__reddit__get_post` | permalink | Full post content + nested comment tree |
| `mcp__reddit__get_subreddit_posts` | subreddit, limit, category (hot/top/new/rising), time_filter | Subreddit listing |
| `mcp__reddit__get_user` | username, limit | User's recent activity |
| `mcp__reddit__get_user_posts` | username, limit, category, time_filter | User's submitted posts |

**Subreddits and search terms come from** `my-project/lead-sources.md`.

### RSS Feed Endpoints - Medium/Substack only (validated Apr 2026)

**How WebFetch works:** WebFetch takes a URL + a prompt. It fetches the content, converts it, and runs the prompt against it via a small model. You get structured text back, NOT raw XML.

| Platform | URL Pattern | Tool | WebFetch Prompt |
|----------|------------|------|----------------|
| Medium tag | `https://medium.com/feed/tag/TAG` | WebFetch | "Extract all articles: title, URL, author, date, first 300 chars of content" |
| Medium user | `https://medium.com/feed/@HANDLE` | WebFetch | "Extract all articles: title, URL, date, claps/responses if shown" |
| Substack | `https://NEWSLETTER.substack.com/feed` | WebFetch | "Extract all posts: title, URL, date, content summary" |

**Handles come from** `my-project/founder-profile.md` Platform Handles section. **Medium tags come from** `my-project/lead-sources.md`.

**RSS feed limitations (Medium/Substack only):**
- Medium RSS does NOT include claps/responses/read ratio. Use Chrome to visit article pages for engagement data.
- Medium RSS returns only the latest 10 articles per feed. Paywalled articles show abstract only.
- Substack RSS does NOT include open rates. Use Chrome on Substack dashboard if needed.
- WebFetch may summarize long content. For full article text, use Chrome on the article URL as a second pass.

### DO NOT USE (broken or replaced actors)

| Actor | Why |
|-------|-----|
| `supreme_coder~linkedin-post` | Replaced by Chrome direct scraping. Uses your cookies on datacenter IPs. |
| `trudax~reddit-scraper-lite` | Replaced by Reddit MCP server (free, no auth, full content). |
| `apify~google-search-scraper` | Replaced by Medium RSS feeds + WebSearch. |
| `harvestapi~linkedin-post-search` | Returns 0 results |
| `trudax~reddit-scraper` | Requires paid rental |
| `cloud9_ai~medium-article-scraper` | Returns garbage |
| `ivanvs~medium-scraper` | Requires paid rental |
| `apify/linkedin-profile-scraper` | Replaced by Chrome. Account safety risk. |
| `apify/linkedin-posts-scraper` | Replaced by Chrome. Account safety risk. |
| `apify/linkedin-connections-scraper` | Replaced by Chrome. Account safety risk. |
| `apify/reddit-scraper` | Replaced by Reddit MCP server. |
| `apify/web-scraper` | Replaced by RSS feeds (Medium, Substack). |

## 2. Known Issues Registry

Things we've hit before. Never re-discover these.

### KI-1: Notion Actions DB property names
- The Actions DB (ID in `my-project/notion-ids.md`) does NOT have a property called "Status" (the standard Notion status property)
- Known properties: Action (title), Priority, Due, Type, Energy, Time Est, Contact, Notes, Action ID, Created
- **Rule:** Do not filter by "Status" on Actions DB. Filter by Priority or Due instead.

### KI-2: Notion Investor Pipeline DB property names
- The Investor Pipeline DB (ID in `my-project/notion-ids.md`) does NOT have a property called "Status"
- Known properties: Fund (title), Stage, Thesis Fit, Next Date, Next Step, Key Quote, Pass Reason, Check Size, Contact, Investor Type, Deal ID, Updated
- **Rule:** Filter by "Stage" not "Status" on Pipeline DB.

### KI-3: Apify MCP tools may not load (X/Twitter only)
- The Apify MCP server (`@apify/actors-mcp-server`) sometimes doesn't register its tools as deferred tools
- When this happens, `ToolSearch` for "apify" returns nothing
- Apify is now used ONLY for X/Twitter (`apidojo~tweet-scraper`). LinkedIn uses Chrome. Reddit uses its own MCP server (`reddit-no-auth-mcp-server`). Medium/Substack use RSS feeds via WebFetch.
- **Rule:** Test Apify MCP via ToolSearch. If unavailable, only X/Twitter scraping is affected. Fall back to Chrome for X. LinkedIn, Reddit, and Medium are unaffected (they don't use Apify).

### KI-4: VC Pipeline API requires local server
- `http://localhost:5050/api/pipeline` only works if the Python app is running
- Location: configured in `my-project/founder-profile.md` or local project directory
- `WebFetch` returns "Invalid URL" for localhost URLs
- **Rule:** Use `curl` via Bash tool, not WebFetch. If server is down, ask founder to start it or proceed without warm intro matching.

### KI-5: Emdash ban
- NEVER use emdashes in any output. Use commas, periods, or hyphens instead.
- This applies to JSON data, copy blocks, and all written content.

---

## 3. Session Budget & Hard Splits

The morning routine runs in a single session using the agent pipeline.
Agents communicate via bus/ JSON files, not context. If context runs low,
the PostCompact hook re-injects critical state.

### Context-Saving Rules
- Never hold raw scrape results (Chrome, RSS, Apify) in context. Save to bus/ or `output/lead-gen/` immediately.
- Never generate content for the wrong day (Tue=TL, Fri=Medium).
- Step 5.9 Phase 2: score in batches of 10. Discard sub-10 immediately.
- Step 5.9b: cap at 10 engagement targets.
- Meeting prep: only today's meetings get full prep.
- Steps 6-7: skip if context < 40%.

---

## 3b. Phase-to-Step ID Mapping

The orchestrator runs phases 0-9. The logging/audit system uses step IDs. `bus-to-log.py` bridges between them.

| Phase | Agents | Step IDs (for logging) |
|-------|--------|----------------------|
| 0: Preflight | 00-preflight, 00-session-bootstrap, canonical-digest.py | 0f_connection_check, 0a_checkpoint, 0b_missed_debrief, 0b.5_loop_escalation, 0c_load_canonical, 0c_canonical_digest, 0d_load_voice, 0e_load_audhd |
| 1: Data Ingest | 01-calendar-pull, 01-gmail-pull, 01-crm-pull, 01-vc-pipeline-pull, copy-diff.py | 1_calendar, 1_gmail, 1_crm_contacts, 1_crm_pipeline, 1_vc_pipeline, 1c_copy_diff |
| 2: Analysis | 02-meeting-prep, 02-warm-intro-match, 02-x-activity | 2_meeting_prep, 1.5_warm_intro, 2.5_x_activity |
| 3: LinkedIn | 03-linkedin-posts, 03-linkedin-dms, 03-prospect-pipeline, 03-content-intel | 3_linkedin_activity, 3.8_dm_check, 3.5_dp_pipeline, 3.7_content_intel |
| 4: Content | 04-signals-content, 04-value-routing, 04-post-visuals, 04-founder-brand-post | 4_signals_linkedin, 4_x_signals, 4_x_hot_take, 4_x_bts, 4.1_value_drops |
| 5: Pipeline | temperature-scoring.py, 05-lead-sourcing, 05-pipeline-followup, 05-loop-review, 05-connection-mining, 05-engagement-hitlist | 5.8_temperature_scoring, 5.9_lead_sourcing, 5.85_pipeline_followup, 5.86_loop_review, 5.9b_engagement_hitlist |
| 6: Compliance | compliance-check.py, 06-positioning-check, 06-client-deliverables, 04-marketing-health, 06-sycophancy-audit | 6_decision_compliance, 7_positioning_freshness, 4.5_marketing_health |
| 7: Synthesis | 07-synthesize | 8_briefing_output, 8.5_start_here |
| 8: Build | build-schedule.py, 08-visual-verify, bus-to-log.py, audit-morning.py | 11_html_output |
| 9: CRM Write-back | 09-crm-push, 10-daily-checklists | 9_crm_push, 10_daily_checklists |

---

## 4. Step Completion Log

Every step writes to `output/morning-log-YYYY-MM-DD.json` as it completes. This is the flight recorder.

### Log Format

  },

}
```

### How to Write the Log

All logging uses the helper script `.q-system/log-step.py`. One-liners, no python required:

```bash
# Create the log at session start:
python3 q-system/.q-system/log-step.py DATE init

# Log a step (done/failed/skipped/partial):
python3 q-system/.q-system/log-step.py DATE step_id done "result summary"
python3 q-system/.q-system/log-step.py DATE step_id failed "" "error message"
python3 q-system/.q-system/log-step.py DATE step_id skipped "" "reason"

# Add an action card (for any founder-facing draft):
python3 q-system/.q-system/log-step.py DATE add-card C1 linkedin_comment "Person" "Text..." "https://url"

# Gate check (before Steps 8, 9, 11):
python3 q-system/.q-system/log-step.py DATE gate-check step_8 true ""
python3 q-system/.q-system/log-step.py DATE gate-check step_11 false "missing_step1,missing_step2"

# State checksums:
python3 q-system/.q-system/log-step.py DATE checksum-start field_name value
python3 q-system/.q-system/log-step.py DATE checksum-end field_name value

# Mark cards as delivered (after HTML opens):
python3 q-system/.q-system/log-step.py DATE deliver-cards

# Verification queue:
python3 q-system/.q-system/log-step.py DATE verify "claim text" "source file" true "confirmed"
```

Every command writes directly to disk. Context rot cannot affect it.

---

## 5. Execution Gates

Certain steps MUST NOT start until all prior steps are done or explicitly skipped. This prevents rushing to output without doing the work.

### Gate Definitions

| Gate | Phase | Step ID | Cannot Start Until | Why |
|------|-------|---------|-------------------|-----|
| **Synthesis** | Phase 7 | 8_briefing_output | Phases 0-6 all logged as done/skipped | Briefing must reflect ALL collected data, not partial |
| **Notion push** | Phase 9 | 9_crm_push | Phases 0-8 done/skipped | Can't push actions that weren't generated |
| **HTML build** | Phase 8 | 11_html_output | Phases 0-7 done/skipped | HTML is the final deliverable, must include everything |

### Deliverables Checklist (ENFORCED at Phase 7 gate)

Before Phase 7 (synthesis) can proceed, Claude MUST verify these deliverables exist in bus/ JSON files. Not "step logged" but "output produced."

**Day-invariant (every day):**
- [ ] At least 3 pipeline follow-up items -- Phase 5, pipeline-followup.json (step ID: 5.85_pipeline_followup) -- with copy-paste text. Notion Contacts DB queried for warm/active contacts with Last Contact > 7 days, follow-up DMs/emails drafted for each.
- [ ] LinkedIn engagement comments with copy-paste text -- Phase 5, hitlist.json (step ID: 5.9b_engagement_hitlist)
- [ ] Connection requests with copy-paste notes -- Phase 5, hitlist.json (step ID: 5.9b_engagement_hitlist)
- [ ] LinkedIn Comments tab was checked -- Phase 3, linkedin-posts.json (step ID: 3_linkedin_activity) -- log must say "comments tab" not just "posts"

**Mon/Wed/Fri:**
- [ ] Signals LinkedIn post with copy-paste text -- Phase 4, signals.json (step ID: 4_signals_linkedin)
- [ ] X signals post, 280 char max -- Phase 4, signals.json (step ID: 4_x_signals)
- [ ] X hot take -- Phase 4, signals.json (step ID: 4_x_hot_take)
- [ ] X BTS post -- Phase 4, signals.json (step ID: 4_x_bts)

**Monday additional:**
- [ ] Medium draft, 800+ words -- Phase 4 (step ID: 4_medium_draft)
- [ ] Content intelligence baselines updated -- Phase 3, content-intel.json (step ID: 3.7_content_intel)

**Tue/Thu:**
- [ ] TL LinkedIn post with copy-paste text -- Phase 4 (step ID: 4_tl_linkedin)
- [ ] TL X post -- Phase 4 (step ID: 4_tl_x)

**Loop checks (every day):**
- [ ] Phase 0 loop escalation ran (step ID: 0b.5_loop_escalation)
- [ ] Phase 5 loop review ran with follow-ups -- loop-review.json (step ID: 5.86_loop_review)
- [ ] No level 3 loops remain unresolved (`python3 q-system/.q-system/loop-tracker.py list 3` returns empty)
- [ ] Every action card generated today has a corresponding loop opened in `output/open-loops.json`

**If any deliverable is missing:** Do NOT proceed to Phase 7 (synthesis). Go back and generate it. The HTML is useless without copy-paste content.

**Phase 4 value drops (step ID: 4.1_value_drops):** REQUIRED. If today's signals match any active prospect by industry/role/tools, a personalized value-drop message MUST be generated. If no signals match any prospect, log "no matches" with the reason.

**Phase 3 LinkedIn Comments tab:** The linkedin-posts.json result must explicitly mention "comments tab checked" or it fails the deliverables check. Checking only the Posts tab is incomplete.

---

### Agent Prompt Loading (REQUIRED before every phase)

Before executing ANY phase, Claude MUST read the agent prompt file from `.q-system/agent-pipeline/agents/` to load that phase's requirements into context. Each agent prompt is a standalone file with its own bus reads/writes, model allocation, and deliverables. This combats "Lost in the Middle" by keeping each agent's context fresh and focused.

### HTML Build Verification (AUTOMATIC)

The build script (`build-schedule.py`) automatically runs `verify-schedule.py` before generating HTML. If verification fails, the HTML is NOT built. Claude cannot bypass this. The verification checks:
- Pipeline follow-ups section exists with 3+ items with copy-paste text
- Day-specific content exists (signals Mon/Wed/Fri, TL Tue/Thu, Medium Mon, Kipi Wed)
- Section ordering is correct (follow-ups before new leads)
- Items have energy tags

If the build is blocked, Claude must go back and complete the missing work, then rebuild.

### How Gates Work

Before starting any gate step, Claude MUST:
1. Re-read the morning log file from disk (not from context memory)
2. Verify the Deliverables Checklist above (Step 8 gate only)
3. Check that every step before the gate is logged as `done` or `skipped`
4. If any prior step shows no entry (never logged), STOP and report:

```
GATE CHECK FAILED at Step [gate step]

Step [missing step] was never logged. It was either skipped silently or forgotten.
Cannot proceed to [gate step] without completing or explicitly skipping [missing step].

Options:
1. Go back and run the missing step
2. Log it as skipped with a reason: [founder tells me why]
```

A step can only be marked `skipped` if:
- It's day-conditional and today isn't the right day (e.g., Monday-only steps on a Friday)
- A dependency failed (e.g., VC Pipeline API down) - BUT Claude must notify the founder and wait for the founder to decide next steps. Claude does not self-decide the fallback.
- The founder explicitly says "skip it"

**Claude cannot self-authorize skipping a required step. EVER.** This means:
- Claude cannot decide "this is lower priority today" and skip a step
- Claude cannot decide "we did this yesterday so we don't need it today" and skip a step
- Claude cannot decide "context is running low" and skip a step
- If Claude thinks a step should be skipped, it MUST ask the founder first: "Step X is next. Do you want me to run it or skip it today?"
- If the founder doesn't respond, the step runs. The default is ALWAYS run, never skip.
- Skipping without asking is a rule violation that gets flagged in the audit.

---

## 6. Action Cards with Confirmation Tracking

Action cards track the difference between "Q drafted something" and "the founder actually did it." This prevents false assumptions about what happened.

### Action Card Format (in morning log)

```json
{
  "action_cards": [
    {
      "id": "C1",
      "type": "linkedin_comment",
      "target": "Michael Morrison",
      "draft_text": "That governance gap in IAM is exactly...",
      "card_delivered": true,
      "founder_confirmed": false,
      "logged_to": []
    },
    {
      "id": "P1",
      "type": "linkedin_publish",
      "target": "Signals post - CISA advisories",
      "draft_text": "Three critical security issues...",
      "card_delivered": true,
      "founder_confirmed": false,
      "logged_to": []
    },
    {
      "id": "E1",
      "type": "email",
      "target": "James Wilson (JPMorgan)",
      "draft_text": "Hey James, happy Friday...",
      "card_delivered": true,
      "founder_confirmed": false,
      "logged_to": []
    }
  ]
}
```

### Rules

- **"card_delivered" = true** means Q showed it to the founder in the HTML or briefing. This is NOT "done."
- **"founder_confirmed" = true** means the founder explicitly said they did it (in a future message or session). Only THEN does Q update state files.
- **"logged_to"** lists which state files were updated when the action was confirmed. Must include ALL relevant files (LinkedIn Tracker, Contacts DB, morning-state, etc.).
- Cards stay in `delivered, unconfirmed` state between sessions.
- **Next morning, Step 0b reads the previous day's morning log** and asks about each unconfirmed card: "Yesterday I drafted these for you. Which ones did you actually do?"
- Never log a comment/DM/email as "posted" or "sent" until the founder confirms it.
- Never update LinkedIn Tracker, Contacts DB, or relationship status based on a draft. Only on confirmation.

### How This Changes the Morning Routine

- Step 5.9b (engagement hitlist): Creates action cards for each comment/DM/request
- Step 4 (content): Creates action cards for each post draft
- Step 8 (briefing): Creates action cards for email replies
- Step 11 (HTML): All action cards appear as checkable items
- Step 0b (next morning): Reads yesterday's unconfirmed cards, asks founder

---

## 7. State File Checksums

At session start and end, read key fields from critical state files and check for consistency. This catches drift between files that should agree.

### Tracked State Files

| File | Key Fields to Snapshot |
|------|----------------------|
| `memory/morning-state.md` | Last sync dates (Calendar, Gmail, Notion, LinkedIn, X) |
| `my-project/relationships.md` | Count of active DP prospects, count of active VC conversations |
| `my-project/current-state.md` | Demo status, what's built vs vision |
| `canonical/decisions.md` | Rule count, last rule added |
| `memory/marketing-state.md` | Content cadence counts, publish log last entry |

### Checksum Format (in morning log)

```json
{
  "state_checksums": {
    "session_start": {
      "morning_state_last_calendar_sync": "2026-03-11",

### Rules

- At session START (Step 0c): Read key fields from all tracked files, log to morning log under `state_checksums.session_start`
- At session END (Step 12 audit): Re-read the same fields, log under `state_checksums.session_end`
- Compare start vs end. Any change should be explainable by what the session did.
- **Cross-file consistency check:** If `relationships.md` says 17 DP prospects but the Notion Contacts DB query returned 15 with DP status, flag the divergence.
- If files disagree, update them ALL to match reality (the Notion DB is the source of truth for counts).

## 8. Verification Queue

Claims that cross sessions get verified. Q does not trust data older than 48 hours without re-checking.

### What Gets Verified

| Claim Type | How to Verify | Staleness Threshold |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| "Commented on [person]'s post" | Check LinkedIn via Chrome (Comments tab) | 24h |
| "Sent DM to [person]" | Check LinkedIn messaging via Chrome | 24h |
| "[Person] accepted connection" | Check invitation-manager via Chrome | 48h |
| "Email sent to [person]" | Check Gmail sent folder | 48h |
| "Lead score [X]" | Re-check if original post is > 72h old | 72h |
| "DP Status = [X]" | Query Notion Contacts DB | 48h |
| "[Person] replied" | Check Gmail inbox or LinkedIn DMs | 24h |

### Verification Queue Format (in morning log)

```json
{
  "verification_queue": [
    {
      "claim": "Commented on Michael Morrison's IAM post",
      "source_file": "linkedin-tracker entry from 2026-03-12",
      "verified": false,
      "verification_method": "Check LinkedIn comments tab via Chrome",
      "result": null
    },
    {
      "claim": "Phil Venables reviewing materials",
      "source_file": "morning-state.md open items",
      "verified": true,
      "verification_method": "Gmail shows his reply + Assaf's response with attachments",
      "result": "Confirmed. Materials sent 2026-03-13."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Rules

- Step 0b (session start): Read previous day's morning log. Check for unverified claims. Add them to today's verification queue.
- Step 3.8 (DM/accept check): Naturally verifies DM and connection claims as part of the check.
- Any claim marked "done" in a state file that can't be verified gets flagged: "UNVERIFIED: [claim]. Re-checking needed."
- Never carry an unverified claim forward for more than 2 sessions. After 2 sessions without verification, downgrade it: mark as "unconfirmed" in the relevant state file.

## 9. Post-Execution Audit Harness

After Step 11 (or whenever the routine ends), run the audit. This MUST happen even if context is tight.

The audit script (`q-system/.q-system/audit-morning.py`) checks:
1. Step completion against expected steps for the day
2. Gate compliance (were gate checks actually performed?)
3. Action card counts (how many delivered, how many still unconfirmed from yesterday?)
4. State file drift (did checksums change as expected?)
5. Verification queue (any stale unverified claims?)

Run:
```bash
python3 q-system/.q-system/audit-morning.py q-system/output/morning-log-YYYY-MM-DD.json
```

Show the output to the founder. This is not optional. If the verdict is not COMPLETE, the founder sees exactly what was missed.

## 10. Integration Points

| System File | What Changes |
|-------------|-------------|
| `commands.md` Step 0f | References this file for tool manifest and known issues |
| `commands.md` Step 0b | Reads previous day's morning log for unconfirmed action cards |
| `commands.md` Step 0c | Snapshots state file checksums at session start |
| `commands.md` every step | Writes completion to morning log + creates action cards for founder-facing outputs |
| `commands.md` Steps 8, 9, 11 | Gate check: re-read morning log from disk, verify all prior steps logged |
| `commands.md` Step 12 | Run audit harness, snapshot state checksums, verify claims |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Rule: "Read `.q-system/preflight.md` before every `/q-morning` run" |
| `memory/morning-state.md` | Audit results appended to track completion rate over time |

### Reading Order for `/q-morning`

1. `.q-system/preflight.md` (this file) - tool manifest, known issues, session budget, gates, action cards
2. Read previous day's morning log (if exists) for unconfirmed action cards and stale verification items
3. Run Step 0f connection checks using the tool manifest
4. Create today's morning log file (empty structure with all sections)
5. Snapshot state file checksums (Step 0c)
6. `.q-system/commands.md` - execute steps, logging each to morning log
7. At gate steps (8, 9, 11): re-read morning log from disk, check all prior steps
8. After Step 11: run audit harness, show result to founder
