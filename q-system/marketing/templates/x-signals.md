> Used by `/q-morning` Step 4 (daily), alongside LinkedIn signals.
> Punchier, headline-style version of the signals post.

---

## Pre-Generation Steps

Same as linkedin-signals.md. Generated from the same signal selection.

## Structure

```
[LEAD - 280 char max. Headline-style. Most shocking fact or stat from top signal.]

[Link: {{YOUR_SIGNALS_URL}}]
```

## Rules

- Lead tweet: 280 characters max (hard limit)
- No hashtags in lead tweet (wastes characters)
- Punchier than LinkedIn version
- Numbers and specifics over generalities
- No product pitch
- Link to {{YOUR_SIGNALS_URL}}

## Output Format

Saved alongside LinkedIn signals in `output/signals-post-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Post-Generation

1. Save to signals file
2. Add to Daily Posts page (if using Notion)
3. Create Content Pipeline DB entry if marketing system active
