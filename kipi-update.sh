# One answer to "what does the disposable dry-run copy contain?".
#
# Two consumers must agree: the rsync that BUILDS the model, and the symlink
# walk that VETS it. A path the rsync skips can never be reached by a write, so
# refusing on a symlink inside it blocks the instance forever -- personal-brand's
# broken canonical links refused cole-gtm, its parent, for a sync that never
# touches personal-brand. A path the walk skips but the rsync copies is
# unvetted. They were kept in step on 2026-07-25 by passing one list into the
# other as argv, which is a wire between two lists, not one list.
#
# Copy only what this sync can write into. A directory holding its own .git
# below the root is a SEPARATE repository -- in the fleet, another registered
# instance with its own entry and its own update run -- and the sync never
# descends into one; it writes to the subtree prefix, .claude/ and plugins/.
# Scar 2026-07-25: ASK_AI_consultant is /Users/assafkipnis/projects/consulting,
# the parent of ten nested instances, so a faithful whole-tree model wanted
# 21GB of scratch for a sync that touches about 100MB. It ran the data volume
# down to 605MB free before it was killed.
#
# Cached per instance root so two callers cannot observe two different trees.
# PATHS THE SYSTEM ITSELF WRITES INTO AN INSTANCE.
# The dirty-tree guard below refuses ANY tracked modification, which is correct
# for founder work and wrong for the updater's own exhaust: measured 2026-08-04,
# 6 of 23 instances sat 2-6 prd-os versions behind and 4 were blocked SOLELY by
# files this system wrote (the monthly sycophancy stamp, hook state, and a
# plugins/ tree an EARLIER update staged and never committed). The fleet updater
# was blocked by itself, silently. This list is deliberately narrow and explicit:
# anything not named here is treated as founder work and still refuses.
# THE ONE plugin-copy exclusion set (ASK-772). Two consumers derive from it and
# they answer halves of a single question:
#
#   the per-plugin rsync         -- "never copy this into an instance"
#   the source-provenance preflight -- "never alarm about this, because it is
#                                       never copied"
#
# Writing the set down twice is how a secret shipped. `.gitignore:3` is `*.env`
# and kipi-design's cip/generate.py reads a plugin-root .env for API keys, so a
# gitignored plugins/<name>/.env was invisible to `git status` and copied happily
# by rsync into all 23 instances (Codex, PR #149 round 3).
#
# Adding it to ONE consumer swaps one failure for another: rsync-only leaves the
# preflight aborting the whole fleet over a file that can no longer leak (a
# denial of service on every update), preflight-only leaves the leak open and
# silent. Hence one list.
#
# Each entry is "<rsync --exclude pattern>::<regex matching the same paths>".
# Two representations, adjacent, because rsync globs and grep regexes are not
# interconvertible in bash without a converter more fragile than the duplication
# it removes. `::` is the delimiter, not `|`, because the regexes contain `|`.
# test-kipi-update-plugin-excludes.sh drives BOTH consumers off this list and
# fails if they disagree, so agreement is proven behaviourally rather than by
# the two strings having been typed the same.

# Was this exact content EVER shipped by the skeleton for this path? (Codex

# blocked instance 2026-08-14: both plugins/prd-os/.claude-plugin/plugin.json and
# plugins/prd-os/tests/test_judgment_compiler.py DIFFER from the current
# skeleton, so a current-only test calls both founder work and the instance stays
# blocked on every unattended update. The fix would have unblocked zero

#
# The honest question is not "is this the newest skeleton content" but "did this

# INSTANCE-LOCAL, AND COMMITTING IT IS WHAT DESTROYS IT (measured 2026-08-14, 6 instances).
#
# Measured 2026-08-14: 6 instances lost their integrity baseline to `kipi update`
# and the tripwire then refused EVERY tool call on them
# (claude-integrity-tripwire.py: "BASELINE MISSING on an armed tree", exit 2).
# The chain is a loop this file closes on itself:
#
#   1. the block below COMMITS the baseline, so it becomes tracked;
#   2. the skeleton's `git archive HEAD` does not contain it (.gitignore:116 --
#      it is instance-local by ASK-282, and a shared baseline can never match a
#      per-instance .claude/settings.json);
#   3. kipi-update-preserve-scan.py rule 3 protects only paths the skeleton NEVER
#      tracked. The skeleton DID track this one (e25734cb / 629d01b2) and then
#      deleted it, so the scan reads a deliberate skeleton deletion and correctly
#      lets `rsync --delete` propagate it.
#
# Step 3 is not the bug and must not be "fixed": a never-delete exemption there
# would make preserve-scan lie about its own rule, which exists so real skeleton
# deletions reach the fleet. The two instances that escaped did so only because
# their baseline was still untracked, which is the state this list restores.

# classifier free to re-add it -- and the classifier demonstrably does exactly

# Preflight: the bytes fanned out must be the bytes that were reviewed.
#
# q-system/ is copied with `git archive` from HEAD, and the two checks above
# refuse when the index and HEAD disagree. `.claude/` and `plugins/` get no
# such protection: they rsync from $SCRIPT_DIR -- the WORKING TREE, on whatever
# branch it is checked out on. Nothing asked which branch that was.
#
# Scar 2026-08-14 (sp-ea9c1628): kipi-system sat on sana/ask-728-plugin-parity
# holding an uncommitted partial forward-port of voiceloop/selector.py -- the
# nearest-length ranking without the anchor-survives fix Codex caught in #147
# and main already carried. A run from that state writes code strictly OLDER
# than main into every config-sync instance and prints PASS. Silent, plausible,
# and 23 repos wide; hence a preflight rather than a habit.
#
# Two halves, deliberately different in what they need:
#
#   DIRTY runs always. Staleness against HEAD needs no remote to be wrong, and
#   an untracked file under plugins/ rsyncs just as happily as a tracked one --
#   `git diff` is blind to it, so it is asked for by name.
#
#   BRANCH arms only when an `origin` remote exists. SKELETON_BRANCH names a
#   branch ON origin; a repo with no origin has no main to be stale against,
#   and every kipi-update fixture in q-system/.q-system/scripts/test/ is
#   exactly that repo. It announces the disarm rather than going quiet, because
#   a silent guard is indistinguishable from one that passed.
#
# Pinned by test-kipi-update-source-provenance.sh.
# SCOPED TO WHAT ACTUALLY RSYNCS, not to `.claude/` wholesale. The config sync
# copies .claude/{agents,output-styles,rules}/*.md and .claude/settings.json --
# nothing else under .claude/ ever reaches an instance. A wholesale check would
# abort on .claude/worktrees/ and settings.local.json, which protect nothing and
# would get the guard switched off. (The worktrees dir is ignored only in this
# clone's .git/info/exclude, so on a fresh clone the wholesale form fires on the
# repo's own worktree convention.) plugins/ stays whole: the syncer walks each
# managed plugin with `find`, so an untracked file inside one is copied too.
# IGNORED IS NOT ABSENT (Codex review of #149 round 3, major). `git status` hides
# ignored files by default, but rsync does not: the plugin copy excludes only
# .git/, __pycache__/, *.pyc, .venv/ and .pytest_cache/, so a gitignored
# plugins/<name>/.env goes to all 23 instances. That is not hypothetical --
# `.gitignore:3` is `*.env` and kipi-design's cip/generate.py reads a plugin-root
# .env for API keys. A guard that claims to cover what rsyncs has to look where
# rsync looks, so plugins/ is scanned with --ignored=matching and then filtered
# by the SAME five exclusions the rsync uses. Measured on this repo the day it
# was written: 0 such files, so the guard arrives green and fires on the next one.
#
# The .claude half is the mirror-image mistake, caught as a minor in the same
# round: it was recursive where the copy is a flat `*.md` glob, so a nested or
# non-md file raised an alarm nothing could act on. `:(glob)` makes `*` stop at
# the directory separator; a bare pathspec would let it match subdirectories and
# re-widen the very scope this narrows.

    # .gitignore:123. No instance has ever had those lines: root .gitignore is
    # not in this script's sync set (q-system/, .claude/{agents,output-styles,
    # rules}/*.md, .claude/settings.json, plugins/). So on an instance the
    # untracked marker is REPORTED by git status, auto-commit.py classifies
    # q-system/.q-system/ as `chore` exhaust, and the next ordinary session
    # commits it straight back. The migration below would then have to run
    # again, and again, forever.
    #
    # That is not a prediction. SYSTEM_NEVER_COMMIT closes this script's own
    # commit path; the commit that re-added the marker to an instance at
    # 2026-08-14 14:22 carried auto-commit.py's subject ("chore: update system
    # infrastructure"), not this script's ("...before skeleton sync"). Two
    # writers, and the array only ever guarded one of them.
    #
    # Ignoring the path guards every writer at once -- this script, the Stop
    # hook, a stray `git add -A`, the founder's own commit -- because it works
    # at the layer all of them read. The stanza is PARSED from the skeleton's
    # own .gitignore, so adding a fourth never-commit path there reaches all 22
    # instances without touching this file.
    #
    # ADVISORY FOR THE UPDATE, A HARD PRECONDITION FOR THE UNTRACK
    # (PR #165 review round 6, major -- a defect in this block's first version).
    #
    # That version said: "an instance that cannot take the block is not a reason
    # to abandon an otherwise good update, and the untrack below still runs."
    # The first half is right and the second half is the bug. `git rm --cached`
    # leaves the marker on disk UNTRACKED; if the ignore rules are not in place
    # at that moment, git reports it and the next ordinary session's auto-commit
    # puts it straight back. So a failed block turned the untrack from a repair
    # into the exact regression the ordering exists to prevent -- and it would do
    # it again on every run, because the marker's one line is a timestamp the
    # tripwire rewrites on every arm.
    #
    # Leaving the marker TRACKED is the stable state. It is where 5 instances
    # already sit, the sync still works, and the next run can retry. Untracking
    # without ignoring is strictly worse than not untracking at all.

      # Measured 2026-08-14, full dry sweep of 23 instances: 11 refusals, 10 of
      # them preceded by that announcement. One instance named 3 files, 2 of
      # them untracked, and refused with all 3 still dirty. (Instance NAMED in
      # the sweep log, not here: the skeleton ships to every instance, so an
      # instance name in a skeleton script is a propagation leak, which Gate 1
      # refuses. Learned the hard way on this very commit.)
      #
      # FILES, NEVER DIRECTORIES (Codex review of #151, major). "Pathspec-limited"
      # was not the safety I claimed it was: sys_owned_dirty carries DIRECTORY
      # entries -- `plugins/<name>` for every managed plugin, from
      # system_owned_paths_for_run -- and `git add <dir>` recursively stages every
      # untracked file beneath it. That includes untracked SOURCE a founder is
      # mid-edit on inside a managed plugin. Measured on this repo: 91 such paths
      # under plugins/kipi-core, 47 under plugins/prd-os.
      #
      # auto-commit.py:170 refuses source by extension precisely so the fleet
      # never commits founder code (ASK-712). Handing `git add` a directory walks
      # straight past that file-level decision. The fix for a silent commit
      # failure must not become a silent commit of the wrong thing.
      #
      # So each entry is expanded to the paths that are ACTUALLY dirty under it,
      # and every one of those is re-classified by the same auto-commit.py the
      # untracked loop above uses. A path the classifier will not call system
      # state is dropped here even though its parent directory is system-owned.
      # Without the classifier present we add nothing new -- the tracked entries
      # still stage, which is what unblocks the sync, and unclassifiable
      # untracked content is left for the guard below to refuse honestly.
      # TRACKED EDITS NEED A DIFFERENT TEST THAN UNTRACKED ONES (Codex review of
      # #151 round 2, major). `git add -u -- plugins/<name>` stages every tracked
      # modification under the directory, so a founder editing a .py inside a
      # managed plugin had it committed under a chore message.
      #
      # But the obvious fix -- run tracked files through auto-commit.py too --
      # breaks the thing this PR exists to fix. That classifier refuses source by
      # extension, and the file blocking 7 of the 11 instances is
      # plugins/prd-os/tests/test_judgment_compiler.py. Classify it and it is
      # refused, never committed, and the instance stays blocked forever.
      #
      # The distinguisher is not the extension, it is AUTHORSHIP, and the skeleton
      # can answer that directly: if the instance's working-tree content for a
      # managed-plugin file is byte-identical to the SKELETON's current content,
      # that content came from the fleet -- an earlier fanout wrote it and failed
      # to commit (ASK-728 did exactly this). Committing it records what is
      # already there. If it differs from the skeleton, someone local wrote it,
      # and it is not ours to take at any extension; it is left dirty so the guard
      # below refuses this instance and protects it.

            #
            #   no staged change          -> index is just HEAD, nothing to lose

            # ONE index question, asked BEFORE any content or deletion reasoning
            # (Codex review of #151 round 5, blocker). Round 5 put the deletion
            # test first so a staged deletion by the fleet would not be misread --
            # and that ordering made deletion skip the index check entirely. A
            # founder stages an edit, the skeleton drops the file, the copy

    # the updated instance sees all of it as drift, quarantines it, and rolls the
    # update BACK. The updater already printed OK. Silent, and on 23 machines.
    #
    # A sanction and not an exclusion: `kipi update` propagates the skeleton's
    # git HEAD, which is the same reviewed provenance the tripwire's own
    # attributable() already treats as sanctioned. Excluding settings.json from
    # the watch set would hand back the whole hole. Phase 3 of the probe holds
    # the other end: a tamper AFTER this call is still caught.

    # --register, NOT a blanket --baseline (review finding, PR #85). A blanket
    # re-baseline re-measures the WHOLE watch set, so any unrelated tamper that
    # happened to be sitting in .claude/ at that moment became sanctioned
    # content, fleet-wide, on every update. The applier's own docstring already
    # named that "the blinding version of this fix"; the updater was doing it.

    # .md copied above, and the two guard scripts the q-system rsync replaced --
    # so an unrelated file cannot ride along.

    # THE WATCH SET IS NOT ONLY .claude/ (review finding, PR #85 round 14, MAJOR).
    # The list was written from the .claude/ half of it while the tripwire's
    # EXTRA_WATCHED has always held two files OUTSIDE .claude/: both guard
    # scripts, which the rsync at the top of this block rewrites on every update.
    # A fresh local commit is in no remote default branch, so head_is_reviewed()
    # is False and nothing absorbed them. Measured on a stand-in instance
    # (probe_round14_findings.sh phase 1): every tool call after a routine update
    # printed `SECURITY: unsanctioned .claude/ change -- 2 modified`, forever, on
    # 23 machines, until a human ran --baseline on each. An alarm nobody reads is
    # the same as no alarm, which is the failure mode both scripts' headers exist
    # to avoid.
    #
    # DERIVED FROM THE TRIPWIRE, NOT TRANSCRIBED: the paths come out of the
    # instance's own EXTRA_WATCHED, so adding a third watched file outside
    # .claude/ cannot leave this list behind.
