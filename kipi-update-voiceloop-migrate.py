"""Migrate ONE instance from the `voicekit` package name to `voiceloop`.

why this exists (sp-8d55455a, 2026-08-30): the rename landed in the skeleton as
cf6acdb4 and shipped `plugins/kipi-core/voiceloop/`. `kipi update` rsyncs
`plugins/` with `--delete`, so a sync DELIVERS voiceloop/ and DELETES voicekit/.
The code that imports it does NOT live under plugins/ -- it is instance-owned
pipeline code (consulting's `q-consult/pipeline/voice.py` puts
`<repo>/plugins/kipi-core` on sys.path and then does `from voicekit import ...`).
A sync therefore removes the name that code asks for and CANNOT rewrite the ask.
Measured 2026-08-30: 24 of 25 registered instances still carried voicekit, so the
next `kipi update` was armed to break the voice pipeline in every one of them.

So this is a MIGRATION, not a rename. The package swap and the import rewrite are
one operation, run per instance INSIDE the update path -- never a one-shot script
somebody remembers to run, because an instance that syncs later without it breaks
in exactly the same way.

## The order, and why it is this order

  1. move  plugins/kipi-core/voicekit -> plugins/kipi-core/voiceloop
  2. rewrite the token in instance source files
  3. (caller) rsync, which lands the skeleton's copy on top of the moved dir

Step 1 first, deliberately. Rewriting imports BEFORE the package has the new name
leaves a window where the instance asks for a name nothing provides; doing the
move first leaves a window where the package answers to a name nothing asks for,
which is inert rather than broken. Each step is independently idempotent, so a
run that dies between them is FINISHED by the next run rather than corrupted:
step 1 no-ops once voiceloop/ exists, step 2 no-ops once no token remains.

## Never a delete

If BOTH voicekit/ and voiceloop/ are present (a half-synced instance), this does
NOT remove either one. It rewrites the imports, reports `both_present`, and
leaves the stale directory for the rsync's own --delete or for a founder
decision. Removing a package directory is a destructive op and it is not this
script's call to make (~/.claude/hooks/destructive-op-deny.sh; the 2026-05-17
scar where an agent "fixed" a mismatch by deleting a production volume).

## What gets rewritten, and what deliberately does not

Extensions in REWRITE_EXTS are things the running system executes or reads as
configuration: a stale token there is a defect. Everything else -- .md, .txt and
especially .jsonl -- is a RECORD. `.prd-os/spillover.jsonl`,
`q-consult/output/postbook.jsonl` and the review docs say what was true when they
were written; rewriting them would falsify history to tidy a grep. They are
counted and reported as `history_left`, never edited.

.json is rewritten and .jsonl is not, and that split is the whole rule rather
than an oversight: .json here is config the engine reads (voice-channels.json
names `voiceloop/validate.py`, a path that genuinely moved), .jsonl is an
append-only ledger.

Prose is never rewritten. In a .py file a comment or a docstring that names the
old package is documenting the rename (the engine's own module docstring, the
exporter's RENAMES note) and must keep the name; Python's tokenizer and parser
tell that prose from the code and string literals that genuinely migrate. A .py
file carrying the name that cannot be parsed refuses the instance rather than
being swapped blind. The other REWRITE_EXTS have no such classifier and keep
the blanket swap, comments included.

A path the SYNC DELIVERS is never rewritten, whatever its extension: the rsync
this script runs ahead of writes the skeleton's copy over it seconds later, so
the rewrite is churn at best and a refused commit at worst (2026-09-06: the
engine's own __init__.py documents the rename in its docstring, naming the old
package on purpose). Delivered means the skeleton's q-system/ tree mapped
through the instance's subtree_prefix minus INSTANCE_OWNED_SUBTREES, plus the
skeleton's plugins/<name>/ trees minus PLUGIN_COPY_EXCLUDES, both arrays read
from kipi-update.sh itself (see SKELETON_ROOT). Everything else the instance
holds, including a file the skeleton ships as a template under an owned
subtree, a file at the skeleton root, or its merged .claude/settings.json, is
the instance's and is migrated.

# A FILE THE SKELETON SHIPS IS THE SYNC'S TO DELIVER, NEVER THIS SCRIPT'S TO
# REWRITE. This script lives at the skeleton root and kipi-update.sh runs it
# right before the rsync that copies the skeleton's q-system/ .claude/ plugins/
# over the instance. Any path the skeleton itself carries is therefore
# overwritten seconds later with the skeleton's bytes, so rewriting it here is
# at best a churn commit and at worst a refused one:
#
#   * The skeleton's own plugins/kipi-core/voiceloop/__init__.py names the old
#     package in a why-comment ("this package was called `voicekit` here"),
#     deliberately, as history. Measured 2026-09-06 across the fleet: every sync
#     rewrote that comment in every instance, committed it, and the rsync put the
#     skeleton's copy back, forever ("rewritten=1" on all 22 instances, 7 on the
#     one that also carried six skeleton-shipped q-system scripts and tests).
#   * On the instance whose pre-commit compares the engine to a public mirror,
#     that one-line rewrite is a diff against the mirror, the gate refused the
#     commit, this script reported "migration failed", and the rsync it exists
#     to prepare never started (sp-b0389e48, sp-2c1bcc3f's neighbour).
#
# THE SET IS WHAT THE SYNC DELIVERS, NOT WHAT THE SKELETON CONTAINS. "Exists in
# the skeleton" was the first cut and the reviewer of PR #312 named where the
# two sets differ: a path under an INSTANCE_OWNED_SUBTREES dir (my-project/,
# memory/, .q-system/data/ ...) that the skeleton happens to ship as a template
# is never overwritten, the sync excludes it; a file at the skeleton ROOT
# (kipi-update.sh, lefthook.yml, README.md) is never copied anywhere; the
# instance's .claude/settings.json is MERGED from a template, its own hook
# entries survive, so a stale path there is the instance's to migrate. Exempting
# any of those leaves the old name in place forever and reports verified=True.
# And the instance keeps its q-system under `subtree_prefix` (null for one
# registered instance), so the skeleton's q-system/<x> lands at <prefix>/<x>.
#
# So the exemption is derived, per file, from the same three facts the rsync
# uses: the skeleton's q-system/ tree minus INSTANCE_OWNED_SUBTREES, mapped
# through the instance's subtree_prefix; and the skeleton's plugins/<name>/
# trees minus PLUGIN_COPY_EXCLUDES. Both arrays are read from kipi-update.sh
# itself, the file that will run the rsync, so this script cannot drift from
# it (the deletion guard keeps a hand copy and a test to compare; this one
# reads the owner). If the arrays cannot be read, nothing is exempt and the
# plan says so under `warnings`: rewriting a file the sync would have replaced
# is churn, skipping one it would not have is a stranded import.
#
# The package MOVE (step 1 of apply) is untouched: the old package name is never
# a delivered path, so its files are seen at their pre-move paths and the move
# proceeds; after the move they sit where the rsync delivers the real ones.
