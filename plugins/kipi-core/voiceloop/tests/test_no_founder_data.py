"""The METHOD/DATA boundary, held by a test and not a comment.

Founder-decided split (voice-architecture PRD, 2026-08-06): the plugin ships the
machinery fleet-wide; the operator's corpus stays in their own instance.
kipi-system is a PUBLIC repo, so a corpus line leaking into this tree is not just
architecture drift, it is founder data published to the world.

The check greps the voiceloop tree for distinctive fingerprints of the private
corpus: phrases from his real writing, his instance paths, and personal
identifiers. Distinctive-but-harmless probes, chosen so the test itself does not
become the leak it polices (the public-skeleton rule: name the data class, never
quote the data at length).
